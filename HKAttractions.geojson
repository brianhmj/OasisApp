The summit is occupied by a radio telecommunications facility and is closed to the public.

It is a major tourist attraction that offers views of Central, Victoria Harbour, Lamma Island, and the surrounding islands.",

Hong Kong Disneyland was opened to visitors on Monday, 12 September 2005 at 13:00 HKT. Disney attempted to avoid problems of cultural backlash by incorporating Chinese culture, customs and traditions when designing and building the resort, including adherence to the rules of feng shui. Notably, a bend was put in a walkway near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort entrance so good qi energy would not flow into the South China Sea. The park consists of seven themed areas: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land. The theme park's cast members speak Cantonese, English, and Mandarin. Guide maps are printed in traditional and simplified Chinese as well as English. The park has a daily capacity of 34,000 visitors — the lowest of all Disneyland parks.",

The harbour's deep, sheltered waters and strategic location on the South China Sea were instrumental in Hong Kong's establishment as a British colony and its subsequent development as a trading centre. Throughout its history, the harbour has seen numerous reclamation projects undertaken on both shores, many of which have caused controversy in recent years. Environmental concerns have been expressed about the effects of these expansions, in terms of water quality and loss of natural habitat. It has also been proposed that benefits of land reclamation may be less than the effects of decreased harbour width, affecting the number of vessels passing through the harbour. Nonetheless Victoria Harbour still retains its founding role as a port for thousands of international vessels each year. The harbour is a major tourist attraction of Hong Kong. Lying in the middle of the territory's dense urban region, the harbour is the site of annual fireworks displays and its promenades are used as gathering places for tourists and residents.",

Opened in 1977, Ocean Park became popular, but 22 years later, it was unprofitable and widely expected to close due to the new Hong Kong Disneyland. However, the Park responded with a HK$5.5 billion development plan that saw it expand to over 80 attractions and rides, and steadily grow visitor numbers to 7.6 million in 2014, making it the world's 13th most visited theme park, and one of the largest theme parks in Asia. Half of all visitors now come from mainland China, in growth that parallels rising mainland tourist visitor levels to Hong Kong over the same period.",

Ngong Ping 360 connects Tung Chung, on the north coast of Lantau and itself linked to central Hong Kong by the Tung Chung Line, with the Ngong Ping area in the hills above. This is home to the Po Lin Monastery and the Tian Tan Buddha, both already significant tourist attractions in their own right. Before Ngong Ping 360's opening, the only access was via a mountain road and bus service. Ngong Ping 360 is owned by the MTR Corporation, the operator of Hong Kong's rail system. It was built by Leitner Ropeways and was originally operated by Skyrail-ITM. Skyrail-ITM was removed from the project after an investigation following an incident in June 2007. It is now operated by a directly owned subsidiary of the MTR Corporation.",

Both the main temple building and the pagoda are listed as Grade III historic buildings by the Government of Hong Kong. Groundbreaking and construction of the temple began in 1951 under Yuet Kai and his followers, and the structure was finished six years later. It closed for three years at the end of the 20th century after one of its caretakers was killed in a mudslide caused by poorly-maintained slopes nearby. The main journey up to the monastery is an attraction itself, as the path is lined on both sides with golden Buddhas, each unique and in different poses. Despite the common translation of its name, the monastery actually contains nearly 13,000 Buddha statues.",

It is themed to resemble the remote jungles in Africa, Asia, South America, and the South Pacific. 'To create a land that would make this dream reality,' said Walt Disney, 'We pictured ourselves far from civilization, in the remote jungles of Asia and Africa.' Adventureland provides a 1950s view of exotic adventure, capitalizing on the post-war Tiki craze. Lush vegetation resembles jungles while elements of the 'other' surround the visitor. Tribal performance masks, conga drums, non-American totem poles, exotic animal statues, and architecture of Pacific influence make for a confined area wherein industry and technology take a back seat to uncharted nature. Noted art historian David T. Doris explains Adventureland as, a pastiche of imaginary colonial spaces, conflated within the green and foliate milieu of 'the Jungle.'",

The attraction does feature several references to the Haunted Mansion, such as a Medusa changing portrait, a conservatory, and the busts that turn to follow visitors as they move. References to other Disney attractions include several figures similar to those from The Enchanted Tiki Room in the Tribal Arts room. The Manor's exterior design is inspired by the now-demolished Bradbury Mansion that stood at 147 North Hill Street in Los Angeles' Bunker Hill, designed by Samuel Newsom and Joseph Cather Newsom, who also designed the still-standing Carson Mansion in Eureka, California. The attraction utilises a trackless ride system similar to that used in Pooh's Hunny Hunt. It features a musical score by Danny Elfman.",

The site occupies what was originally the grounds of Queen's College, which built a school on the site in 1889. After wartime damage, the site was repurposed as quarters for married junior policemen. The compound is listed as a Grade III historic building since 2010. In 2014, after nearly 15 years of disuse, the building was renamed PMQ and opened to the public. The building's residential units were turned into studios, shops and offices for creative enterprises and exhibition spaces. The mission of PMQ is to nurture local designers, provide a stage for creative happenings and create a place for visitors to experience creative lifestyle; it is a not-for-profit social enterprise supporting Hong Kong brands and innovation.",

The trail is extremely popular with local residents for its unique combination of well-marked paths through verdant woods that offer relief from the sun on sunny days, and featuring numerous streams and waterfalls. The trail offers a wide variety of terrain -- it can be steep at some parts, flat at others, with both gradual ascents and descents. The trail takes a very indirect route; termination points Victoria Peak and Big Wave Bay are less than 11km apart. Because the trail is composed of eight sections, much shorter runs or hikes are possible. The popular running path on Bowen Road connects to both Sections 3 and 4 via the steep ascent up the Wan Chai Gap Trail. The best detailed guidebook, which breaks down each of the eight sections with detailed notes, maps and photos, is The Serious Hikers Guide to Hong Kong.",
